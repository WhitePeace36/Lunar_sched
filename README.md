# Lunar

## Introduction

Scx_lunar is a multipurpose scheduler which was originally invented with the goal to make frametimes in games as smooth as possible

Every cpu has 5 queues, one per band. The band is chosen by the nice value of a task,
inside a band the tasks are ordered by vtime, so every task of a band gets its fair share.

## Dependencies

```
cmake clang pkgconf libbpf bpf
```

kernel compiled with flag `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y`

for the kernel option you can just check if `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` is present.

But this kernel option should be enabled by default, but not bad to check never the less.

## Important

The nice value decides the band of a task (see below). It does not change the slice or
the share of cpu time, it only decides which band is served first.

So nice values are the way to tell lunar what is important. Tools like ananicy-cpp can
be used for that, for example to put audio into band 0, a game into band 1 and
background work into band 3 or 4.

Audio (pipewire, pipewire-pulse, wireplumber) should run with realtime priority or at
least with nice -11 or lower, so it lands in band 0 and nothing else can delay it.


## Building it

```
./build.sh
```

## Installing

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

## Uninstalling

```
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

## Explanation

### Bands

Every cpu has one queue per band. The band is chosen by the nice value:

| Band | Nice |
|---|---|
| 0 | -20 to -11 |
| 1 | -10 to -3 |
| 2 | -2 to 2 |
| 3 | 3 to 10 |
| 4 | 11 to 20 |

Bands are served strictly in order. Most tasks run with nice 0, so they are in band 2.
Band 0 holds high priority kernel threads (kworker/*H, ...) and everything that is
reniced to -11 or lower.

Kernel threads that are bound to one cpu (ksoftirqd/N, kworker/N:x, rcuc/N, ...) always
go into band 0, whatever their nice value. Only they can do the work of their cpu, so
they should never wait behind anything. Unbound kernel threads (kworker/u*) and user
tasks pinned to one cpu are handled by their nice value like everything else.

Every task has a slice of 1ms. Nice values don't change the slice.

### vtime inside a band

Inside a band the queue is ordered by vtime. Every task collects the cpu time it used,
and the task that used the least runs first.

Every cpu keeps a reference per band: the highest vtime that started running in that
band on this cpu. When a task is queued, it gets

key = reference + lag

lag is the lead (negative) or debt (positive) the task has against the reference,
limited to +-1 slice. While a task sleeps the reference keeps moving, so sleeping pays
off debt, but a task can never collect more than one slice of lead. That way a task
which slept for a long time can't come back and hog the cpu (no lag bombs), and a task
that runs rarely and shortly is always near the front of its band.

A new task starts exactly at the reference, without lead or debt.

When a task is moved to another cpu it keeps its lag against the reference of the new
cpu.

## Preemption

A waking task of a higher band preempts a running task of a lower band. Inside the same
band a waking task preempts when its key is more than 0.25ms earlier than the current
vtime of the running task, so when it used clearly less cpu. Tasks with similar usage
don't preempt each other. The preempted task goes back into its queue with its vtime and
the rest of its slice.

When the slice of a task runs out, its vtime is updated. It keeps running for another
slice if its band is better than every queued band on its cpu, or if in the same band
its key is not later than the one of the first queued task. Otherwise it goes back into
its queue.

## Placement and balancing

When a task wakes up and an idle core is found, it runs there directly.
Otherwise the task goes to the queue of the core with the least work ahead of it:

- an idle core is always preferred
- tasks of band 0 and 1 check all cores of the same llc
- tasks of band 2, 3 and 4 compare their core with 2 random cores of the same llc
  and move at most once every 10ms

Idle cores only look for work when they are woken up. So when a core starts running a
task while other tasks still wait in its queues (for example the task it just
preempted), it wakes an idle core that is allowed to run the first waiting task, and
that core takes it over.

## Dispatch

Each core first runs a starved band if there is one, then its own band 0, then its own
bands 1, 2, 3 and 4. After that it steals from another core of the same llc and then
from cores of other llcs, band by band. From which core the core starts stealing is
randomized for better load distribution.

## Starvation

If the head of a band has not been served for longer than its budget
(band 1 20ms, band 2 50ms, band 3 100ms, band 4 200ms), it gets one slice ahead of the
higher bands, at most once every 10ms per core. Inside a band the vtime makes sure that
nothing starves. The values are in `source/defines.h`.

## CPU hotplug

When cpus go online or offline (for example when toggling SMT) the kernel stops
the scheduler, and lunar restarts itself with the new topology.

## Testing

There where 2 design goals for this scheduler.

1. That music keeps playing normally when executing the cachyos benchmarker https://github.com/CachyOS/cachyos-benchmarker
2. To keep frametimes as smooth as possible with as little frametime spikes as possible. 

As far as i have tested. Both modes do accomplish these tasks very well.

The only problem is i couldn't test the functionality with different llcs as i don't have such an cpu by hand.
The next thing is, that i mostly developed this scheduler with SMT disabled. As i found that SMT off works the best for this ryzen 5800x3d. But you can test both. Your mileage may vary.
